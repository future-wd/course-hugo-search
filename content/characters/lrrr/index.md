Lrrr (pronounced as Lurr) (born October 19, 2925) is one of the main antagonists in Futurama. He is an Omicronian and rules the planet Omicron Persei 8. He wears a red cape and has a brownish body. He is known to have violent habits: while watching Single Female Lawyer, he says "If McNeal wants to be taken seriously, why does she not simply tear the judge's head off?!"

He has been known, along with most of his species, to eat almost anything and kill for no reason. He enjoys Earth sitcoms and will blow up the Earth unless he knows the ending to them.
