Ndnd (pronounced Unda-unda) (born April 8, 2926) is a recurring character in Futurama. She is a female Omicronian and the wife of Emperor Lrrr. In "When Aliens Attack", she was angered by the sudden static during Single Female Lawyer. When Earth got the original airing date, because of Omicron Persei 8 being 1000 light years away, this was the same distance in years from the original airing date, therefore they would have just got the broadcast. She verbally abuses Lrrr everywhere, especially in public.

She and Emperor Lrrr saw Bigfoot while eating a "romantic meal", hosted by a scared Fry in a cage. This brought them closer and made them kiss, letting Fry escape and run away.
