Scruffy Scruffington (born October 31, 2945) is the Planet Express janitor. He originally started off as a minor character, who only made brief cameos in the background, until his speaking debut in "Anthology of Interest I". A recurring joke is that nobody remembers his name or ever seeing him before because of how little he's appeared. Over the seasons, Scruffy became more and more prominent.
